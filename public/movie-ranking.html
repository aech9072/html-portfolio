<h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My Personal Recommendations</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>I've always been a fan of high fantasy movies, and LotR - or Lord of the Rings - by JRR Tolkien is kind of one of the most easily identifiable fantasy realms out there. I might even go so far as to consider it the "gold standard" of fantasy stories and worlds with how much thought and creativity the author poured into the creation of it.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>Everyone starts somewhere in their fantasy journey, and as a young child I started with the Harry Potter series. Even if I've somewhat outgrown my love for it at this point in my life and I don't watch it as often as I did, I think this was one of the gateway series I watched that introduced me to the possibility of hidden magical worlds, while providing me with formative life lessons that I went on to carry with me.</p>

<h3>Hidalgo</h3>
<p>Growing up, I was also a bit of a horse-girl growing up. Horses were, and remain, my favorite animal because of how beautiful and powerful they can be, and how incredible it is once you've earned the trust of one. I watched a lot of horse movies growing up - Black Beauty, The Black Stallion, etc. - that eventually led me to Hidalgo, which is a very powerful story based on the life of Frank T. Hopkins and his race during the Ocean of Fire in Arabia.</p>
